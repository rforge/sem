Changes to Version 3.1-9

    o Changes to C++ code (requested by CRAN).
    
Changes to Version 3.1-8

    o Fixed compilation flags (at request of CRAN).
    
    o Small correction to DESCRIPTION file.

Changes to Version 3.1-7

    o Imports from standard packages to conform to new CRAN policy.
    
    o Moved DiagrammeR to Suggests: .

Changes to Version 3.1-6

    o Added text argument to specifyModel(), specifyEquations(), cfa(), readMoments(), and update.semmod().

    o Modifications to miSem() etc. to work with version 0.9-99 of the mi package (contributed by Benjamin K Goodrich).
    
    o Major upgrades to pathDiagram() and cfa() (implementing suggestions of Michael Friendly).
    
    o Get rid of calls to require().

Changes to Version 3.1-5

    o Small corrections to C++ code by Zhenghua Nie to prevent warnings from valgrind.

Changes to Version 3.1-4

    o Fixed multigroup start values (which failed under some circumstances, reported by Timo von Oertzen).

    o specifyModel() no longer fails when the model has just one input line.

    o specifyEquations() allows structural equations to be split over more than one line.

    o Fixed bug in computing robust statistics in multigroup models when not all variables in the input data set are in the model (reported by Thomas Niemand).

    o summary.tsls() now returns an object, printed by print.summary.tsls() (after question by Steve Koch).

    o Fixed bug suppressing computation of R^2s in a just-identified model (after report by Paula N. Fergnani).

    o Added message to specifyModel() suggesting use of specifyEquations() or cfa().

    o Small fixes.

Changes to Version 3.1-3

    o No substantive changes.

Changes to Version 3.1-2

    o specifyModel() now allows tabs in path specifications.

    o Small fixes for compatibility with R 3.0.0.

Changes to Version 3.1-1

    o Fixed bug in startvalues() when a latent variable has only 1 indicator.

    o Added custom c++ function to print debug iteration history.

Changes to Version 3.1-0

    o Added FIML objective function for handling missing data. (Preliminary implementation for single-group models only.)

    o Added miSem() for multiple imputation.

    o Added bootSem.msem() method for multi-group models; bootSem() now generic.

    o Redefinition of BIC (differs by constant from previous version, suggested by Ken Bollen).

    o Default reference.indicators=TRUE in cfa() (suggestion of Ken Bollen).

    o Added fit.indices argument to summary() methods, along with fit.indices global option. AIC and BIC provided by default; other fit indices (including addition of RNI and IFI, suggested by Ken Bollen) available optionally.

    o New version of startvalues(); old version now named startvalues2().

    o New pathDiagram.semmod() method.

    o Small fixes and changes.

Changes to Version 3.0-0

	o Compiled code for optimization.
	
	o Added multi-group models.
	
	o Modification indices for equality-constrained parameters.
	
	o weights argument added to tsls().
	
	o raw argument added to cfa().

Changes to Version 2.1-2

    o Suppress R^2s when raw moments used (they were not computed correctly).
    
    o Enhancements to update.semmod() and new edit.semmod() (suggestions of Michael Friendly).

Changes to Version 2.1-1

    o Added cfa() for compact specification of confirmatory factor analysis models.

Changes to Version 2.1-0

	o Added equation-style model specification, via specifyEquations()
	
	o Fixed bug in classifyVariables() when <- (rather than ->) used in the model.
	
	o Fixed bug in vcov.sem() when the model has just one structural parameter or just one variance/covariance parameter.

Changes to Version 2.0-0

    o Completely reworked version of the sem package. See CHANGES file for changes to older versions.
